# Backtesting

`BacktestEngine` (backend `strategy` module, `com.swingtrade.strategy`) replays the Phase 2
price-action entry rules bar-by-bar against historical OHLCV candles to measure how the
strategy would have performed. It reuses the exact rule thresholds from
`PriceActionSignalEngine` so a backtest can never drift from the rules the live signal
generator applies.

## Entry rules (same as the live signal engine)

All 4 must hold on a given day for a trade to be entered at the **next** day's open:

1. `close > EMA20 > EMA50`
2. `RSI(14)` between 50 and 65
3. `volume > 1.5 × VolumeMA(20)`
4. `close` within 3% of the trailing 252-day high

## Exit rules (checked in this priority order, each day a position is open)

1. **STOP_LOSS** — day's low touches `entry - atrMultiplierStop × ATR(14)`
2. **TARGET_HIT** — day's high touches `entry + rewardRiskRatio × (entry - stopLoss)`
3. **TREND_BREAK** — `close < EMA20` for 2 consecutive days
4. **TIME_STOP** — held for `maxHoldingDays` bars

Position size is `floor(capital × riskPerTradePct / (entry - stopLoss))`.

## Triggering a backtest

```bash
# Single symbol, default config (see BacktestConfig.defaults())
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/backtest/run?symbol=RELIANCE&exchange=NSE"

# Every symbol in the active watchlist, saves a JSON+CSV report under ./reports
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/backtest/run-all?exchange=NSE"

# List saved reports (most recent first)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/backtest/reports"

# Fetch a specific saved report
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/backtest/reports/backtest_20260705_020000.json"
```

A weekly job (`BacktestScheduler`) also runs `/run-all` automatically every Sunday at 02:00 IST
across the active watchlist.

`exchange` is accepted for API symmetry but does not currently filter candles — OHLCV data
isn't partitioned by exchange in the schema today.

## Interpreting `BacktestResult`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `totalTrades` / `winningTrades` / `losingTrades` | Trade counts. A trade counts as a win if `pnl > 0`. |
| `winRate` | `winningTrades / totalTrades × 100`. |
| `avgGainPct` / `avgLossPct` | Average `pnlPct` across winners / average absolute `pnlPct` across losers. |
| `maxDrawdownPct` | Largest peak-to-trough drop in the equity curve. |
| `sharpeRatio` | `(mean daily return / stdev daily return) × √252`, computed from an equity curve that only changes on trade-exit days (no intraday mark-to-market of open positions). |
| `totalReturn` | `(finalCapital - initialCapital) / initialCapital × 100`. |
| `expectancy` | `winRate/100 × avgGainPct − (1 − winRate/100) × avgLossPct`, in percent-per-trade terms. |
| `trades` | Full list of `BacktestTrade` records (entry/exit dates, prices, stop/target, exit reason, pnl). |

`BacktestReportSummary` (returned by `/run-all` and saved as the JSON report) additionally
aggregates: top 10 symbols by win rate, top 10 by total return, and portfolio-wide
(trade-weighted) win rate and (mean) Sharpe ratio.

## Known limitations

- `BacktestConfig.maxConcurrentPositions` is reserved for a future multi-symbol, shared-capital
  portfolio simulation. Today each symbol is backtested independently with its own capital pool
  (`runBacktestAll` loops `runBacktest` per symbol), so at most one position is ever open per
  symbol — there's no cross-symbol capital contention to cap yet.
- The Sharpe ratio and drawdown use an equity curve that only updates at trade exits (no
  intraday mark-to-market of unrealized P&L on open positions), a common simplification for
  daily-bar swing backtests.
